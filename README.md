# [GTAVMP](https://sdw.seven-labs.com/gtavmp/) [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/samuelwalton/GTAVMP/total.svg)]()

A re-visited online co-op modification for GTA5. Originally developed by Guap and made current by N4N0. Does not use Rockstar's Online code therefore in theory (tested) should not cause your account to be banned.

If you have questions be sure to check the [wiki](https://github.com/Guad/GTACoop/wiki) first.
